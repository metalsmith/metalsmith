> An extremely simple, _pluggable_ static site generator.

In Metalsmith, all of the logic is handled by plugins. You simply chain them together. Here's what the simplest blog looks like...

```js
Metalsmith(__dirname)
  .use(markdown())
  .use(templates('handlebars'))
  .build(function(err) {
    if (err) throw err;
  });
```

...but what if you want to get fancier by hiding your unfinished drafts and using custom permalinks? Just add plugins...

```js
Metalsmith(__dirname)
  .use(drafts())
  .use(markdown())
  .use(permalinks('posts/:title'))
  .use(templates('handlebars'))
  .build(function(err) {
    if (err) throw err;
  });
```

...it's as easy as that!


## Installation

    $ npm install metalsmith


## Plugins

Check out the website for a list of [plugins](http://www.metalsmith.io#the-plugins).


## How does it work?

Metalsmith works in three simple steps:

  1. Read all the files in a source directory.
  2. Invoke a series of plugins that manipulate the files.
  3. Write the results to a destination directory!

Each plugin is invoked with the contents of the source directory, and each file can contain YAML front-matter that will be attached as metadata, so a simple file like...

    ---
    title: A Catchy Title
    date: 2014-12-01
    ---
    
    An informative article.
  
  ...would be parsed into...

```js
{
  'path/to/my-file.md': {
    title: 'A Catchy Title',
    date: new Date('2014-12-01'),
    contents: new Buffer('An informative article.')
  }
}
```

...which any of the plugins can then manipulate however they want. And writing the plugins is incredibly simple, just take a look at the [example drafts plugin](examples/drafts-plugin/index.js).

Of course they can get a lot more complicated too. That's what makes Metalsmith powerful; the plugins can do anything you want!


## The secret...

We keep referring to Metalsmith as a "static site generator", but it's a lot more than that. Since everything is a plugin, the core library is actually just an abstraction for manipulating a directory of files.

Which means you could just as easily use it to make...

  - [A simple project scaffolder.](examples/project-scaffolder)
  - [A simple build tool for Sass files.](examples/build-tool)
  - [A simple static site generator.](examples/static-site)
  - [A Jekyll-like static site generator.](examples/jekyll)
  - [A Wintersmith-like static site generator.](examples/wintersmith)

## CLI

In addition to a simple [Javascript API](#api), the Metalsmith CLI can read configuration from a `metalsmith.json` file, so that you can build static-site generators similar to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) or [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io) easily. The example blog above would be configured like this:

```json
{
  "source": "src",
  "destination": "build",
  "plugins": {
    "metalsmith-drafts": true,
    "metalsmith-markdown": true,
    "metalsmith-permalinks": "posts/:title",
    "metalsmith-templates": "handlebars"
  }
}
```

And then just install `metalsmith` and the plugins and run the metalsmith CLI...

    $ node_modules/.bin/metalsmith
      
        Metalsmith · reading configuration from: /path/to/metalsmith.json
        Metalsmith · successfully built to: /path/to/build

Or if you install them globally, you can just use:

    $ metalsmith
      
        Metalsmith · reading configuration from: /path/to/metalsmith.json
        Metalsmith · successfully built to: /path/to/build

Options recognised by `metalsmith.json` are `source`, `destination`, `concurrency`, `metadata`, `clean` and `frontmatter` - See "*API*" section below for usage.

Checkout the [static site](examples/static-site), [Jekyll](examples/jekyll) or [Wintersmith](examples/wintersmith) examples to see the CLI in action.

If you want to use a custom plugin, but feel like it's too domain-specific to
be published to the world, you can include plugins as local npm modules:
(simply use a relative path from your root directory)

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "./lib/metalsmith/plugin.js": true
  }
}
```

## API

Checkout the [project scaffolder](examples/project-scaffolder) or [build tool](examples/build-tool) examples to see a real example of the Javascript API in use.

#### new Metalsmith(dir)

Create a new `Metalsmith` instance for a working `dir`.

#### #use(plugin)

Add the given `plugin` function to the middleware stack. Metalsmith uses
[ware](https://github.com/segmentio/ware) to support middleware, so plugins
should follow the same pattern of taking arguments of `(files, metalsmith, callback)`,
modifying the `files` or `metalsmith.metadata()` argument by reference, and then
calling `callback` to trigger the next step.

#### #build(fn)

Build with the given settings and call `fn(err, files)`.

#### #source(path)

Set the relative `path` to the source directory, or get the full one if no `path` is provided. The source directory defaults to `./src`.

#### #destination(path)

Set the relative `path` to the destination directory, or get the full one if no `path` is provided. The destination directory defaults to `./build`.

#### #concurrency(max)

Set the maximum number of files to open at once when reading or writing.  Defaults to `Infinity`.  To avoid having too many files open at once (`EMFILE` errors), set the concurrency to something lower than `ulimit -n`.

#### #clean(boolean)

Set whether to remove the destination directory before writing to it, or get the current setting. Defaults to `true`.

#### #frontmatter(boolean)

Set whether to parse YAML frontmatter. Defaults to `true`.

#### #ignore(path)

Ignore files/paths from being loaded into Metalsmith. `path` can be a string,
or an array of paths. Glob syntax is supported via
[minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch).

#### #metadata(json)

Get the global metadata. This is useful for plugins that want to set global-level metadata that can be applied to all files.

#### #path(paths...)
 
Resolve any amount of `paths...` relative to the working directory. This is useful for plugins who want to read extra assets from another directory, for example `./templates`.

#### #run(files, fn)

Run all of the middleware functions on a dictionary of `files` and callback with `fn(err, files)`, where `files` is the altered dictionary.


## Metadata API

Add metadata to your files to access these build features. By default, Metalsmith uses a few different metadata fields:

- `contents` - The body content of the file, not including any [YAML frontmatter](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/frontmatter/).
- `mode` - The numeric version of the [file's mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_%28Unix%29).

You can add your own metadata in two ways:

- Using [YAML frontmatter](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/frontmatter/) at the top of any file.
- Enabling [a plugin](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith/blob/master/Readme.md#plugins) that adds metadata programmatically.

#### mode

Set the mode of the file. For example,

```
$ cat cleanup.sh

--
mode: 0764
--

rm -rf .
```

would be built with mode ```-rwxrw-r--```, i.e. user-executable. 


## Troubleshooting

### Node Version Requirements
Metalsmith v2.0 and above uses [generators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator) which has some considerations for `node.js 0.12.x` and below.

#### Using `node.js 0.10.x`
You have two options:

1. Upgrade to latest stable version of `node.js` (>= `0.12.x` — see "*Using `node.js 0.12.x`*" section below)
2. Use Metalsmith v1.7. Put `"metalsmith": "^1.7.0"` in your `package.json` and `npm install` that version.

#### Using `node.js 0.12.x`
You have three options:

1. Run `node.js` with `--harmony_generators` flag set.
    1. `node --harmony_generators my_script.js`
    2. Using `package.json`: `"scripts": {"start": "node --harmony_generators my_script.js"}`. Run with `npm run`
2. `npm install` [harmonize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/harmonize) and require before Metalsmith is used. e.g. `require("harmonize")(["harmony-generators"]);`
3. Use Metalsmith v1.7. Put `"metalsmith": "^1.7.0"` in your `package.json` and `npm install` that version.
