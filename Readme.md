# Metalsmith

An extremely simple, _pluggable_ static site generator.

In Metalsmith, all of the logic is handled by plugins. You simply chain them together. Here's what the simplest blog looks like...

```js
Metalsmith(__dirname)
  .use(markdown())
  .use(templates('handlebars'))
  .build();
```

...but what if you want to get fancier by hiding your unfinished drafts and using custom permalinks? Just add plugins...

```js
Metalsmith(__dirname)
  .use(drafts())
  .use(markdown())
  .use(permalinks('posts/:title'))
  .use(templates('handlebars'))
  .build();
```

...it's as easy as that!

## Installation

    $ npm install metalsmith

## Plugins

Check out the website for a list of [plugins](http://www.metalsmith.io#the-plugins).

## How does it work?

Metalsmith works in three simple steps:

  1. Read all the files in a source directory.
  2. Invoke a series of plugins that manipulate the files.
  3. Write the results to a destination directory!

Each plugin is invoked with the contents of the source directory, and each file can contain YAML front-matter that will be attached as metadata, so a simple file like...

    ---
    title: A Catchy Title
    date: 2014-12-01
    ---
    
    An informative article.
  
  ...would be parsed into...

```js
{
  'path/to/my-file.md': {
    title: 'A Catchy Title',
    date: new Date('2014-12-01'),
    contents: new Buffer('An informative article.')
  }
}
```

...which any of the plugins can then manipulate however they want. And writing the plugins is incredibly simple, just take a look at the [example drafts plugin](examples/drafts-plugin/index.js).

Of course they can get a lot more complicated too. That's what makes Metalsmith powerful; the plugins can do anything you want!

## The secret...

We keep referring to Metalsmith as a "static site generator", but it's a lot more than that. Since everything is a plugin, the core library is actually just an abstraction for manipulating a directory of files.

Which means you could just as easily use it to make...

  - [A simple project scaffolder.](examples/project-scaffolder)
  - [A simple build tool for Sass files.](examples/build-tool)
  - [A simple static site generator.](examples/static-site)
  - [An Jekyll-like static site generator.](examples/jekyll)
  - [An Wintersmith-like static site generator.](examples/wintersmith)

## CLI

In addition to a simple [Javascript API](#api), the Metalsmith CLI can read configuration from a `metalsmith.json` file, so that you can build static-site generators similar to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) or [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io) easily. The example blog above would be configured like this:

```json
{
  "source": "src",
  "destination": "build",
  "plugins": {
    "metalsmith-drafts": true,
    "metalsmith-markdown": true,
    "metalsmith-permalinks": "posts/:title",
    "metalsmith-templates": "handlebars"
  }
}
```

And then just install `metalsmith` and the plugins and run the metalsmith CLI...

    $ node_modules/.bin/metalsmith
      
        Metalsmith 路 reading configuration from: /path/to/metalsmith.json
        Metalsmith 路 successfully built to: /path/to/build

Or if you install them globally, you can just use:

    $ metalsmith
      
        Metalsmith 路 reading configuration from: /path/to/metalsmith.json
        Metalsmith 路 successfully built to: /path/to/build

Checkout the [static site](examples/static-site), [Jekyll](examples/jekyll) or [Wintersmith](examples/wintersmith) examples to see the CLI in action.

## API

Checkout the [project scaffolder](examples/project-scaffolder) or [build tool](examples/build-tool) examples to see a real example of the Javascript API in use.

#### new Metalsmith(dir)

Create a new `Metalsmith` instance for a working `dir`.

#### #use(plugin)

Add the given `plugin` function to the middleware stack.

#### #build(fn)

Build with the given settings and call `fn(err, files)`.

#### #source(path)

Set the relative `path` to the source directory, or get the full one if no `path` is provided. The source directory defaults to `./src`.

#### #destination(path)

Set the relative `path` to the destination directory, or get the full one if no `path` is provided. The destination directory defaults to `./build`.

#### #metadata(json)

Get the global metadata. This is useful for plugins that want to set global-level metadata that can be applied to all files.

#### #join(paths...)
 
Join any amount of `paths...` to the working directory. This is useful for plugins who want to read extra assets from another directory, for example `./templates`.
